Before running the project, make sure to install all dependencies:

npm install

Start the project with:

npm start

Run the tests with:

npm test

**Notes:**
- I didn’t always follow the course instructions exactly, as some steps didn’t work in my setup. For example, I downloaded the API module file directly into my project folder instead of linking it in index.html.
- I separated the time reducer (`initializeTimes` and `updateTimes` functions) from `Main.js` because importing them directly from `Main.js` into my test files caused errors.

Feedback is welcome—thanks for reviewing my project!
